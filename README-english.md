This repository contains the open source website that we at **Coding Bunker** are developing for the non-profit organization **Ero Forestiero**.

## Ero Forestiero
### What is Ero Forestiero
Ero Forestiero is a non-profit **association** in the city of Vigevano (PV), Italy.

Their main activity is **alphabetisation courses** for **adult immigrants** and was created to respond to the **educational, relational and support needs** of second generation immigrant children.

Their activity is characterised by an **educational** and **non-assistance** logic.

Every activity is carried out on the basis of the **principle of hospitality** and starting from the **PERSON**, who is never seen as a mere user of a service, but rather as the custodian of a set of **values** and **humanity** deserving special attention and adapted almost ad personam.

All services offered by the association are **free**.

The association organises a **training course** for **volunteers** every year before the start of Italian classes, to improve the training offer and to promote group cohesion. 

The language courses are divided into **three levels**, basic, intermediate and advanced, for each of which specific tools and teaching methods are provided.

The training course is a fundamental part of the association's activities because, as well as providing a framework for the teaching method from a didactic point of view, it is also a time for **reflection** and **opening up** to the local area thanks to the presence of external speakers to explore cultural, religious, normative and methodological issues. 

The course, created for volunteers but open to everyone - members of the association or just curious people - sees its natural continuity throughout the year through **round tables** and **meetings organised** by the association and open to everyone.

### Goal
The **goal** that we at **Coding Bunker** have set ourselves is to **create a website** for the association to help it **digitally expand** and make itself known in its territory and beyond.

### Tech Stack
We are building the site as a **WordPress theme** developed from scratch.
Therefore, we develop using:
 -  HTML
 -  CSS
 -  JavaScript
 -  PHP

### How to install the project locally
 - Make sure you have a web server installed on your computer: WAMP, MAMP, LAMP, XAMPP or other...
 - Make sure you have a local WordPress installation. If you don't have one, we recommend this guide: https://wordpress.org/support/article/how-to-install-wordpress/
 - Clone the code into the folder containing the WordPress themes. Usually the path is C:\xampp\htdocs\project name\wp-content\themes
 - Access the local WordPress administration panel (remember to activate your web server first)
 - Go to Appearance -> Themes
 - Click on the "Activate" button in the box of the installed theme

### Why join the project
Thanks to the work in this project, it is possible to first of all **learn** and **practice** the languages and technologies mentioned above, and above all to do so on a **real and concrete project** (and not just a simple "showcase" project).

In addition, you have the opportunity to learn **soft skills** through **team working**, **feedbacks** and **time and task management**. These are important skills for the workplace, allowing you to differentiate yourself and be perceived as an expert.

Last but not least, the **ethical and social side** of the project will make you perform a **good deed** towards a non-profit organisation and therefore to all intents and purposes a **volunteer**.
It is very important not to think only of ourselves, but to strive and commit ourselves also to the **good of others** and of those who are often not as fortunate as we are. 
It can only be good for our **Heart** and our **Soul**.

### How to apply
The **minimum requirement** to apply is to know and have a minimum of experience in Front End web development with **HTML**, **CSS** and **JavaScript**, Back End web development with **PHP** and **MySQL** and familiarity with the **CMS WordPress**.

If you are interested in participating in the project, you can do so by emailing us at [info@codingbunker.it](mailto:info@codingbunker.it).

### Benefits of being part of the project
Everyone who contributes to the website will receive certain benefits:
 - Will be nominated **Contributor** within the Discord server
 - Will be **inserted on the website** in the Contributor section, so that it is **visible** to all subsequent visitors.
 - wWll be able to list this experience on **Linkedin** as volunteering
 - Will be able to include the project in his or her **work portfolio**, if he or she has one.
We will choose people who show us that they **have the minimum requirements** to participate and are really **motivated** to do so.
